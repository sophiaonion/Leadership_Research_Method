1. A few individuals on your usually high performing team have been underperforming in minor ways for a few weeks but you have said nothing so far. What would you do now?
Call the whole team together to discuss the need for better performance than the past few weeks.
Talk to lower performing people on the team individually (one at a time).
Ask one of the more trusted and longer experienced people on team what they think you should do.
Do nothing at this stage as performance has yet to really suffer badly.

3. You have decided to introduce a new budgeting process for your area (after much argument and dissatisfaction about the efficiency and accuracy of the old one). You would:
Prepare a background paper or report on the new approach you are proposing and why youhave chosen it (and circulate it to all team members).
Gather input from every individual on your team on what they would like to see in the newapproach before finalizing your thinking by yourself and then presenting your new system in a group meeting.
Talk to other supervisors about which budgeting approaches have tended to work best in their teams (and why) before holding a group brainstorming session on what should be donewith your own team.
Ask your own manager what he or she would like to see in place.

5. Lately your group has not been able to come up with solutions to problems, or their solutions do not work out. Morale has become very low among your group members. How do you boost the teams moral?
You tell your group that their performance has been very disappointing and they need to start working harder.
You single out the worst performing group member and use them as a scape-goat, saying the team would be doing better if it we are for their terrible ideas.
You remain positive and encouraging and tell the team things will get better and start taking short breaks when seemingly unsolvable problems arise.
All your group members are capable adults, they can figure it out themselves. Just wait for this lull to pass.

7. A group member starts undermining your authority. They show up late, are unwilling to participate and even begin to rudely criticize every decision you make in front of the rest of the group. How do you approach this situation?
Ignore them. After all you are the superior one, why does their opinion matter.
Call them out in front of the whole group and say that if anyone is doing a poor job it is them.
Bring it straight to your superiors. This should not be your problem and the employee obviously is not going to listen to what you have to say.
Talk to them privately and tell them they are being disruptive and ask them to take you and their job a little more seriously. If they still cause issues, then report them to your superiors.

9. You are approaching a problem that you know will be difficult for your group. How do you present the problem to your group to make it seem more doable?
You give it to them strait. They should know this is basically an impossible task.
You remind your team of the skills they do have and how they could be useful so you can present the problem bluntly but reinforce it is doable. 
You put the problem off and do minor things first and only deal with the problem when you have to. 
You try to make the problem sound not so bad and then just leave it for your group to figure out.
10. "I enjoy competing against an opponent."

11.  Your group begins displaying signs of aggression toward one another and things soon become very heated and no one is trying to solve the task at hand anymore. What do you do?
Tell the group to calm down and get back to work.
Try to figure out what the problem is and find a compromise that satisfies everyone. Then remind them they are a team and need each other for this task and then address the task again.
Just let them work it out on their own. The task will get dealt with when it does.
Tell the group you do not care if they like each other, they just need to figure out a way to work together.
